# UserScripts

Recently I find [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/) and [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) can let users change some websites' behavior. This repositories stores some styles / scripts I wrote to make some webwites to fit my favour. 

If you find any bugs or you have any suggestions, welcome to [open an issues](https://github.com/fish-404/UserScriptsStyles/issues/new/choose) or [open a discussion](https://github.com/fish-404/UserScriptsStyles/discussions/new).
